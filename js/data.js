There is no real equivalent to the Celtic Bard in Anglo-Saxon England, however. In Ireland and Scotland, the use of the word Bard apparently fell  into some disrepute, as the records we have show that the Bard was simply a  minor poet, while the filidh (seer) or the ollave (master poet) occupied  the former status and functions of the Bard.In Wales, the Bard was not so lucky. There, the traditions ossified, and the Bards, after the advent of Christianity, became Court Poets, known as Gogynfeirdd, or Prydydd, limited in subject matter and form, and with rigidly structured rules. The word that corresponds with the irish filidh, in Welsh, would be derwydd, (oak-seer) the word from which druid is derived. The hedge-Bards were the ones that carried on the real traditions of the Bard. These are the people that gave us the Cad Goddeu and the Hanes  Taliesin, and who may have passed the Matter of Britain on to the French troubadors and trouveres, thus giving us Arthur and Camelot. The word Bard, in Wales, denoted a master-poet. In Ireland it meant a poet who was not an Ollave, one who had not taken all the formal training.  Apparently even the lower-status Irish Bard was on a level with the Welsh Bard in knowledge and poetic education, however, and these were what I have termed hedge-bards, above. In the Celtic cultures, the Bard/Filidh/Ollave was inviolate. He could travel anywhere, say anything, and perform when and where he pleased. The reason for this was, of course, that he was the bearer of news and the carrier of messages, and, if he was harmed, then nobody found out what was happening over the next hill. In addition, he carried the Custom of the country as memorized verses...he could be consulted in cases of Customary (Common) Law. He was, therefore, quite a valuble repository of cultural information, news, and entertainment. A true Bard must know the following: music (and the playing of aperiod instrument, preferably Harp), poetry (original, and other people's), song (original and other people's), the History, Law and Custom of his/her Kingdom and of the SCA, as much knowledge of mundane medieval history, Law, and custom as they can possibly learn, and at least a very basic knowledge of linguistics and alphabet/cyphers. Some training in Folklore, and in the art of Sociology would help, too. See the list of suggested College courses at the end of this article. The Bard should investigate the Matter of Britain very thoroughly, paying special attention to Sir Gawain, and to Arthur's Queen. Do a little reading in the Robin Hood cycle, too, with special attention to the village festivals in Britain that mention him. Some Bards are titled, that is, someone, be it another Bard, or  whoever, or sometimes (very seldom) the Bard himself, has given them a bardic name or title, that serves to identify them. Thusly, I am known as y bardd Gwyn, Bard Ban, or the Whyte Bard. Another was known as Derwydd Prydain, while even another has no title at all, and does not want one. Be wary of taking such a title yourself. Allow the giving of such to happen on its' own, and do NOT take it from a King of any kind! Each individual Bard will have certain perogatives that they have  developed over the years. I, myself, tend to interrupt a Coronation court at any time with a poem, or a song, relating to the event. Other Bards will have other perogatives. Don't try to set yourself up with these; let them happen naturally. ON MUSIC AND SONGWRITING: Every so often, one hears a self-important scholar say something  along the lines of: Well, you have only written new words, or parodied  the words, to a common tune....this is NOT real songwriting, but simply filk (as termed in the Science Fiction sub-culture) songs. Tell them to sit on it. This is, and was, an accepted thing to do, is quite legitimate, and very authentic. Just try to keep the general sound as Medieval/Renaissance as  possible...admittedly a bit difficult when you are stealing ** er ** adapting  a rock and roll melody, but it CAN be done....and please encourage others to do the same. ON BARDIC CIRCLES: A Bardic Circle is, simply, a setting for the listeners to entertain each other. This can be with poetry, song, and stories. All should  participate, though it is not necessary for all to contribute to make it a fun thing to do. What IS necessary is that the number of things done by each  person at any one time be limited, to keep the inevitable stage-hog from monopolizing the evening, and to keep the Awful No-Talent Stage Hog from  running everyone off. I recommend that each person be limited to TWO songs, poems or  whatever at a time, and then pass on to the next singer. This keeps it  varigated, and interesting, and gives EVERYONE a chance to contribute. Try to keep discussion to a minimum, but, should it be interesting, let it go on for a while, as a break in the music. In any event, try to do something different about every hour or so, to allow your listeners to  stretch, use the bathroom, get refreshments, and gossip for a while. This will keep them there longer, and add more fun to the occasion.";
// kanye quotes
var kanye = "Respect my trendsetting abilities. Once that happens, everyone wins.   I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things.   I think what Kanye West is going to mean is something similar to what Steve Jobs means. I am undoubtedly, you know, Steve of Internet, downtown, fashion, culture.   I will go down as the voice of a generation.    Come on now! How could you be me and want to be someone else?   I am Warhol! I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney, Nike, Google.   People are going to look at this interview and say, 'I don’t like Kanye. Look, he looks mad. I don’t like his teeth.'   I’m the No. 1 living and breathing rock star. I am Axl Rose; I am Jim Morrison; I am Jimi Hendrix.   When someone comes up and says something like, 'I am a god,' everybody says 'Who does he think he is?' I just told you who I thought I was. A god. I just told you.   I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting.   It’s only led me to complete awesomeness at all times. It’s only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness.    I just see like, an amazing person that I’m in love with that I want to help.   Kate Upton ain’t Marilyn Monroe, Kim is Marilyn Monroe, you know that.   I get to represent somebody I don’t think is getting represented right now. The regular dude: the guy who believes in God but still likes pussy.   I feel like the type of girl I would be with is a fellow superhero.   Look at the drive that people have to get sex — to dress like this and get a haircut and be in the club in the freezing cold at 3 A.M., the places they go to pick up a girl. If you can focus the energy into something valuable, put that into work ethic ...    She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist… have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?     Yeah, kill self. That’s all I have to say. Kill self.   If you don’t make Christmas presents, meaning making something that’s so emotionally connected to people, don’t talk to me.   Don’t nobody care about what Obama wearing. You care about the sweatshirt I got on because I know you like, 'That sweatshirt rocks!'   No flip flops for black dudes. I don’t care where you at.   There are people who dress better than me, just not many celebrities. I think I have leeway because I'm a rapper and I'm black. I think fashion people expect less of black people.     Great art comes from great artists. There’s a bunch of people that are hurt that still couldn’t have made the album that was super-polarizing and redefined the sound of radio.   I am a black new wave artist.   I am in the lineage of Gil Scott-Heron, great activist-type artists.   As a man I am flawed, but my music is perfect.   My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.   Don't ask me what I think the best song of last year was, because my opinion is the same as most of America's. It was Gold Digger.   Rap is the new rock and roll. We the rock stars… We the rock stars, and I’m the biggest of all of them.    I will completely bow to anybody I respect.   When I think of competition it's like I try to create against the past. I think about Michelangelo and Picasso, you know, the pyramids.   Look at Gaga. She’s the creative director of Polaroid. I like some of the Gaga songs. What the f*** does she know about cameras?    You can’t look at a glass half full or empty if it’s overflowing.  Twitter, 2010  In my humble opinion, that's a prophetic statement. Gandhi would have said something like that.   I believe that utopia is actually possible—but we're led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician—I'm usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct.   George Bush doesn’t care about black people.    I don’t know if this is statistically right, but I’m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven’t won one against a white person.   White-people food? You know what it is. You never ate fried chicken and said, 'This tastes white.'    You know, if Michael Jordan can scream at the refs, me as Kanye West, as the Michael Jordan of music, can go and say, 'This is wrong.'   A horrible album with just Jesus Walks on it is a four! C’mon dog, the demo version was a five! You need to rate it again, but you’ll have to create a new rating system.   What if you did music, and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio? That's how interviews are! ";

var madsci = "Some toys are destined to be broken in the child's attempt to discover the source of their magic sway.  No doubt many engineers have sprung from such troublesome children, surrounded by the empty wreckage and clinging dust of a trashed Etch-a-Sketch. This gives us proposition one: a good toy is one with high mortality rates.     Furthermore, a plaything's power rises in proportion to the simplicity with which it suggests elementary social or physical phenomena.  Social toys date since the first time a stick was raised in mock attack (war) and a doll with the vaguest of human outlines was cradled (love).  But in a second, more Apollonian category are objects--are they toys?--intended basically for admiring.  Here's a list of current contenders and their provenance:  Suspended metal clacking balls--Newtonian mechanics; the lava lamp--heat transfer and cavitation with non-Newtonian, low-Reynolds-number fluid dynamics; and the Slinky--wave propagation, somersaults, and the mysterious, entrancing animation of nothing but a dinky piece of metal tape.     One Slinky expert's epiphany reveals the toy's pull.  In 1946 W.J. Cunningham was midway in his first year as a professor in Yale University's electrical engineering department when someone gave him a Magi-Koil.  It was a helical steel spring with about 80 turns.  The helix was a ribbon of thin, rectangular steel, and if left undisturbed each coil stacked almost entirely on the next.  The diameter was about 2-1/2 inches and the whole thing about the size of the box a baseball comes in.      Oscillated with two hands it looks like pouring water, as energy is resupplied as the captivated user pretends he is weighing fruit. Or, you put it on a top step, pull one end to the step below, and let it do the rest.  According to the ads, it could walk as though it were alive.  Today it would be difficult to find a child who disputes that.  The Magi-Koil was renamed the Slinky, a mechanical engineer made a mint on it, and today it's essentially unchanged.  Prof. Cunningham still hasn't figured out how it works.     Forty years ago Cunningham had printed a paper quantifying the actions of his intriguing new toy.  Today he still teaches at Yale, and also is chairman of the board of editors of American Scientist magazine.  Writing in the May-June 1987 issue of the magazine, he denigrates his earlier self-assurance, now that he is less sure he really understands all that goes on.      In an interview he elaborated on the problems.  The general idea is pretty obvious, but even with all the physical measurements I wanted I couldn't tell you the minimum height of step to kick it off on a walk down the stairs.  It's tied up with the damping in the spring, which is hard to measure to begin with.  What's clear is the larger the damping in the spring, the larger the step height, and I can tell you how long it will take to go down the step.  But working from first principles I have not been abe to set up a predictive mathematical model.      Before looking at the analytical theory of Slinkyonics (as we'll see, there is no one scientific domain within which its actions can be described), we can get a sense of its odd-ball usefuleness.  In Vietnam, American soldiers used it as antennae for radios; its jiggles have been been used to predict the onset of an earthquake; while being observed intently from Earth, Space Shuttle astronauts have used it to while away the orbiting hours and prove--in case you were worried--conservation laws.     Who needs the $4 billion supercollider when you have the Slinky?  One paper in the American Journal of Physics suggested that a moving Slinky, when hung in the air by thread at various points, models the  types of waves in gas plasma.  Cunningham recently received a physics paper on dispersion waves, from a woman who attached one end to the side of a door, which acts as a soundboard.  She stretched the thing out, and snapped the wire at the far end.  Try this at home.     The first sound that comes out, says Cunningham, is called a whistler --a high-frequency whoop-whoop, like a descending bird cry with a sharp ascent, or, to my ears, an eerily synthesizer sound-alike suitable for a Star Trek episode.  A short time later, said Cunningham, warming to the imitation, comes a deep voiced phew-phew, a sharply descending cry from the bird's older brother.  There is far too much ambient noise in my apartment for me to ever actually hear these frequencies.  But the point is that the high frequencies travel along the spring faster than the low ones, each at a particular dispersion.  Stepping out.  The Slinky in its preeminent role, as sinuous stair descender, exhibits different characteristics, most prominently what is called an extensional disturbance wave.  A spring is a medium with distributed mass and stiffness.  In a spring with a linear medium, an impulse--disturbance--will travel at a speed of the square root of the ratio of stiffness to density.  But is the Slinky doing its stuff linearly?     Midway through its jaunt down the steps, the Slinky has two essentially straight axes connected by a wide-linked, U-shaped arch through which the metal snake seems to draw itself.  The mid-air portion of the spring is stretched out, compared to the compact back foot (the empyting pile) on the upper stair unseating itself, and the collecting pile of turns on the lower stair.     Despite the event's apparent nonlinearity, Cunningham considers it analyzable as a linear case of small deflections along the length of the helical wire itself.  In his study, he considers an idealized Slinky resting horizontally on a frictionless tabletop.  (Surely Plato himself must play in the frictionless land stocked with idealized toys.)  Say the right side of the spring is jerked to the right.  An extensional disturbance travels along the wire with a constant speed.  Each turn moves briefly to the right with a certain particle velocity.  The last turn of the slinky finishes up at twice the speed of the first one.  (We'll see why the speed doubles in a moment.)     Let's move from the heady world of ideals to the hall staircase.  The researcher, or child, has piled the Slinky on one step and obligingly placed the free end on the step below.  Inertial and elastic effects cause a wave to travel through the arched coil upwards--although it looks like the spring is pouring downwards--and the last turn is lifted off the step with velocity twice that of its brothers resting on the step above.  (It's hard to keep it visualized that the spring is a continuum through which the wave passes, even though the visible parts of the coils seem to be knocked against each other one by one.)     If the force is high enough at the critical take-off instant, two events occur: the arch stays arched due to centrifugal force, and the last rung vaults over to the next lower step.  The arch inverts, and by the time the last rung lands, a few adjacent turns are thrown in contact.  The turns pour onto the once high flying turn, now the bottom of the pile.  A new disturbance has begun in the opposite direction.     It may seem that having the free end of the coil moving at twice the speed of the initial coil, while receiving no additional energy, violates conservation laws.  But the explanation is related to the theory of transmission lines.  As the pulse comes down the line, the quantity of material that is moving becomes smaller.  With a decrease in mass, the velocity has to increase to conserve the energy.  It's  similar to when you snap a towel--considering here the snap made in mid-air, not on someone's wet skin--or, even better, to popping a whip.   Massive energy is needed to whip the massive stock of a bullwhip.  A uniform amount of energy travels down the steeply tapered whip.  The crack of the whip is the shockwave when the featherweight flick-end breaks the speed of sound.     A physical case closer to that of the Slinky--propagation made visible by discrete points along the line, and uniform material dimensions--is apparent in curtains made of hanging beads.  (A locale of an exotic boudouir comes to mind.)  Large bead curtains also have a nicer planar aspect and lovely billowing effects, a phenomenom I once noticed as I stood from the second-floor balcony of Avery Fischer concert hall in New York, trying to flick, in exhilarating slow motion, strands of the enormous bead rope against the ankle of a dowager in the lobby.     But a Slinky in action is different than the flick of a beadstring.  The Slinky's two ends are constantly changing their relative situation: one end initiates the pulse, and one end awaits it, and then back again.  Energy is certainly lost inside the spring itself, although with steel it's probably fairly small; energy is also lost when the free end makes an inelastic impact with the step.     The takeoff speed and the material design of the Slinky are critical.  The speed must be high enough to propel it down and over two steps, but the entire rippling effect must be slow enough to be visible.  To slow it down, you need relatively more mass per unit length.  How do you keep down stiffness per length (not the lateral stiffness)?  Edge-wind it: flatten the wire (give it rectangular cross-section) which simply reduces the ratio of stiffness to mass.     The edge-winding of the Slinky reduces the axial length for a fixed mumber of turns, helps the windings stack, and gives a larger lateral stiffness to resist shearing forces--which keeps the slinky from slip-sliding around as it pours into its invisible glass.  The scaling factors for the Slinky are linear, for those of you familiar with the Slinky Jr., a half-size, half speed offspring.  The plastic, brightly-colored Slinky now in the stores moves twice as slowly as the steel one, and is better for engineering demonstrations (and children who gnaw on everything) but is a loser as a toy compared to Old Reliable.     Cunningham's first Slinky is still the only one in his eyes.  Today's brass model, for example, doesn't work nearly as well as the steel, he claims.  The brass doesn't have the the right relationship between Young's modulus and the density--it's not stiff enough against lateral deflection.  Perhaps we need something like the original-instrument movement among the music buffs; otherwise we will never know the true stuff of the device.  Birth and transfiguration.   In November 1945, Gimbel's (remember Gimbel's?) sold out 400 of the brand-new items in 90 minutes.  Two years later a patent for the Slinky was given to Richard James, a Penn-State mechanical engineering graduate working for Newport News Shipbuilding.  The original design was first licensed out to one Leroy Shane, who marketed the Magi-Koil.  (As we will see, there are some grey areas in the genesis story of the Slinky.)  Eventually, the enterprising engineer founded James Industries Inc., Holidaysburg, Pa., now run by James's widow Betty.  The company's flagship model is made of  cold-rolled spring steel,  as divulged by a tight-lipped Mrs. James, fabricated from round wire rolled out at zero tension, flattened, and twisted into the helix.  The company turns out 6000 Slinkys a day.     What engendered the idea for the Slinky?  At one time voice coils in loudspeakers were made edge-wound, like a Slinky, in order that as much metal as possible could be within the magnetic field.  So goes one theory for the initial design concept, its adaptor to toydom unknown.  But according to Mrs. James, Richard James got the idea when he dropped a  torsion spring.   The quotes you see around the words are because I could not discover exactly what this object is, and Mrs. James could not, or would not qualify her information any further.  Interestingly, Prof. Cunningham received a letter containing a third story, one with darker overtones, but plausible nonetheless.     According to this Deep-throat-delivered story, someone ran a machine shop in Philadelphia making helical piston rings for small gas engines. (Within each engine cylinder, placed over the piston, are two or three springy helical coils of tape that bear against the cylinder wall.  Their expansion keeps the cylinder gas-tight, and the flat coil keeps lubricating oil away from the burning fuel.)  The story goes that, after slicing off the tops of the steel helixes to make the rings, whoever ran the machine shop noticed the properties that now we all know.  The identity of this  whoever  remains shrouded.  Some time later Richard James got wind of the doctored piston rings, and marketed the concept.  The relationship of humanity and staircase was irrevocably altered.";
